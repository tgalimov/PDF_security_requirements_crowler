There are two types of memory violations that might occur: 1) as a result of a hardware fault or SEU and 2) as a result of a common mode (usually, software) error.	nonsec
Memory violations that result from random hardware faults will be detected in the same way as any other hardware fault is detected in the FTPP and don't require memory protection for them to be detected and dealt with.	nonsec

Associated with the message are descriptor fields describing the sender, receiver, the type of message, and how the message is to be exchanged.	nonsec
The unique identifier for an end point consists of a virtual group identifier and a socket identifier.	nonsec
The sending and receiving end points may live on the same virtual group or on different virtual groups.	nonsec

Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) provides the capability to detect and diagnose faults within FCC hardware.	nonsec
The functionality of FDI is decomposed into 2 capabilities-Initial Built-In Test (IBIT) and Continuous BIT (CBIT).	nonsec

The most important requirement is the stability of the system on a high-level user application level, which is a consequence of the availability of basic network and terminal functionality.	nonsec
System failures caused by user operation or network malfunctions have to be avoided.	nonsec
Dead ends in dialogs have to be addressed by a special help system and contextual understanding has to be provided.	nonsec
The system must guide users throughout the interaction process quickly and effectively and it has to be designed to avoid cognitive overloads caused by information overflow.	nonsec
The accesspoint has to be controllable through different modalities.	nonsec
A switch between modalities must not affect the system operations, consequently there should be no need to re-initiate the dialog status.	nonsec
Likewise, it should be possible to switch the current context without loosing perspective in case the system does not estimate the context properly.	nonsec
There is an urgent need for extensibility of the software system.	nonsec
The monolithic implementation which is used at the moment does not support modelling of upcoming functionality requests and it is very difficult to maintain and extend.	nonsec
Although the first prototype complies with the specified functionality we have decided to re-implement it from scratch and carefully design all application interfaces for process communications.	nonsec
Better development tools to handle the speech system on an abstract level are required to improve the process of extending its rule database.	nonsec
For better extensibility, context engines need to be implemented rather than interfaces and the method of choice are neural networks.	nonsec
As for training purposes new tools are needed and should be able to derive input from rule databases which are used at the moment.	nonsec
There are two major aspects which are of vital importance for the acceptance of the terminal in public space applications.	nonsec
Firstly the solid user interface requires high standards in ergonomics and robustness.	nonsec
Secondly the system needs to have a ``subtle notion'' of its services to guide users quickly and effectively.	nonsec
The terminal pro actively offers its services i.e. must be able to attract and help people. It must be self explicable and understand users' needs.	nonsec
It must also be able to handle context specific dialogs.	nonsec
Dialogs which it doesn't understand clearly should be handled properly to limit user frustration.	nonsec
Context switches must be supported at any state of the session and the system should offer alternatives and rank them by guessing its likelyhood.	nonsec
The graphical and speech user interface need to complement each other.	nonsec
They represent input and output channels and provide access to the state of the context engine.	nonsec
The information flow must be compatible with average user capabilities to avoid cognitive overload.	nonsec
The graphical user interface model presents information in an abstract two dimensional way and supports virtual characters engine.	nonsec
The information flow must be compatible with average user capabilities to avoid cognitive overload.	nonsec
The graphical user interface model presents information in an abstract two dimensional way and supports virtual characters.	nonsec
The following adaptivity specifications are limited to single user sessions.	nonsec
It is assumed that multiple user sessions are not very likely to occur in public space applications. They are treated elsewhere.	nonsec
A general single user session occurs when one person in front of the terminal interacts with the system.	nonsec
An onlooker, or person inside the interaction area of the terminal is already considered to be a user.	nonsec
"Some adaptivity related specifications are partly indicated in section ""Usability related specifications'' above."	nonsec
Contextual understanding is an example and support of context switches without explicit requests are another.	nonsec
The interaction process should be as natural as possible and the development should ultimatly enable natural language understanding.	nonsec
"""Technically""' speaking, the system should be able to detect people automatically and doesn't need to be approached by a subject."	nonsec
It should be able to initiate the first step and react adaptively because it can recognize people and distinguish humans from other life, e.g. dogs.	nonsec
Another requirement is speaker independent voice recognition which is essential in public space applications, i.e. every single user is understood instantly irrelevant of age, gender or other distinct characteristics.	nonsec
The terminal is designed to support classical input-output channels like typing or reading, and complement them with speech and visual capabilities.	nonsec
Except for high level features, most of the above mentioned adaptivity specifications primarily rely on multimodality related features.	nonsec
Visual and audio surveillance enable user detection and language understanding through face and speech recognition.	nonsec
At the moment, higher level functions and more powerful features for enhanced sensing can be implemented by combining speech and visual information.	nonsec
Mode switches which are not initiated by the system are only possible through input channels.	nonsec
Output presentation is determined by the system and the user has no direct influence in this case.	nonsec
If desired the user can override default settings, but because of privacy issues, certain output channels are preferred.	nonsec
Certain new usage scenarios require extended functionality which has not been implemented yet.	nonsec
Simulation and testing will provide further insight into the integration process and give more practical hints on usability, before new features engine.	nonsec
The information flow must be compatible with average user capabilities to avoid cognitive overload.	nonsec
The graphical user interface model presents information in an abstract two dimensional way and supports virtual characters.	nonsec
To describe the newly defined specification, the simulation environment should provide an abstract high level scripting language thus providing an interpreter.	nonsec
To ensure extensibility of the software system, an open architecture has been chosen.	nonsec
All functionalities will be implemented using components or even distributed components in a client-server oriented approach.	nonsec
Because of multimedia capabilities operating system selection is virtually limited to the MS Windows based platform.	nonsec
The implementations of the context engine with near natural language capabilities, the multiple modality support functions and the speech and graphical interfaces are heavily component based.	nonsec
The authoring tool provides a set of standard widgets.	nonsec
A widget is a graphical entity representing the interface between a user and the application software.	nonsec
The set of standard widgets contains widgets of the following types: screen, to define properties for a whole screen; dialog, to provide a container for other widgets, excluding screens; text, to provide a field to display a text string; button, to trigger specific actions on a user request; slider, to show the current state of an analogue value, e.g. volume; picture, to display a bitmap, e.g. a logo.	nonsec
The authoring tool provides for each project a project repository containing a font definition, a colour palette, bitmap images and strings.	nonsec
The authoring tool allows the user to manage a palette and its colours. Colours are organised in a palette.	nonsec
The authoring tool allows the user to import bitmaps from an external source.	nonsec
The authoring tool allows the user to simulate a user interface on a PC.	nonsec
The authoring tool provides a complex widget containing a menu structure and a navigation function.	nonsec
The authoring tool should provide a menu editor.	nonsec
This menu editor allows the user to define items in a menu.	nonsec
The authoring tool allows the user to generate C code for a target platform, e.g. a DVD player.	nonsec
The software structure of the firmware should be suitable for adding a ‘UI- interpreter’ (to interprete and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor; so a very important component in this project).	nonsec
For this aspect we have chosen to add/implement a kind of virtual machine which performs the interaction between the UI-Code and the effective hardware/firmware.	nonsec
For performance reasons this VM is closely matched with the firmware.	nonsec
The software (firmware) should be able to control all the available hardware and the hardware state should be accessible to the firmware and be exposed to the UI-Code.	nonsec
The software architecture of the firmware should allow the extension with additional functionality.	nonsec
The UI Editor should allow flexible creation and modification of the user interface of the Vetronics application.	nonsec
This must be done in an interactive and visual way.	nonsec
The UI Editor should be able to communicate with the Vetronics hardware, to download the developed UI to the Vetronics system for real use. This communication is done using different kinds of interfacing (Serial port, USB, FireWire, IrDa, CAN).	nonsec
This communication module is also needed to obtain the system configuration from the Vector Unit.	nonsec
The UI Editor should not only allow the management of the UI of the Vetronics application, but should also support definition of the behavior of the Vetronics system through the connection of real actions to UI elements.	nonsec
The UI Editor itself should be a powerful and user friendly tool. Because we are focussing of Windows-users, the Windows guidelines are taken info account. However, we do not want to obtain the “Designed for Windows ....” Label. It should be compatible with the common versions of Windows (98/ME/2000) and near-future versions.	nonsec
The UI-Editor should be an open-application so we can add new functionality to support new hardware configurations.	nonsec
To obtain this we must create an open framework on which we can Plug-In all functionality we desire.	nonsec
Optimal Video performance on most popular video signals.	nonsec
The firmware should allow extensions of the functionality.	nonsec
The software structure of the firmware should be suitable for adding a ‘UI- interpreter’ (to interpret and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor).	nonsec
This UI-Interpreter has now a more concrete form by means of the dedicated Virtual Machine.	nonsec
The UI interpreter (=VM) should show a “start menu” (defined in the UI by the UI Editor) when the system is powered up.	nonsec
This start menu is the root item for the complete UI-menu tree.	nonsec
The UI interpreter should interpret the downloaded UI code to navigate through the menus and perform defined actions.	nonsec
Because of the event driven firmware, the UI is built on Event-Action associations.	nonsec
The UI interpreter should control the interference between the defined UI and the environmental conditions, such as overruling user-defined UI elements and actions by an “emergency” UI and behavior.	nonsec
This is the decision-agent we need for content prioritization.	nonsec
The UI Editor should allow the user to create/modify menus.	nonsec
Menus are in fact the combination of Overlay (OSD and Symbol Generator), HotSpot zones and Event-Action Associations.	nonsec
The UI Editor should enable the user to associate an event to an action as defined in the previous point.	nonsec
An event-driven approach is envisioned in the first prototype to evaluate its feasibility. Hereby the VM must support this event-driven approach and act as a transparent link between the generated UI-code and the hardware.	nonsec
The UI Editor should also dispose of a facility to associate an event to more than one action.	nonsec
This extension of the event-driven approach raises design issues to be tackled.	nonsec
The UI Editor should provide a compile step to generate code on the development platform.	nonsec
The Editor also allows downloading the generated code in the embedded Vetronics system (where it will be interpreted by the firmware).	nonsec
This is the way the OffLine adaptivity of the Vetronics system is based on.	nonsec
In general, the UI Editor should be a user friendly and powerful development tool. This requires: attention for visualization and simulation issues (WYSIWYG approach, e.g. Visualization of the designed UI, menus, icons, Simulating navigation etc.), the Windows guidelines should be followed, attention for visualization and simulation issues (WYSIWYG approach, e.g. visualization of the designed UI, menus, icons, Simulating navigation etc.), the Windows guidelines should be followed, attention for solutions that speed up the development of the UI (e.g. investigate the use of drag-and-drop tools such as in the context of action definition), attention for solutions that speed up the development of the UI (e.g. investigate the use of drag-and-drop tools such as in the context of action definition).	nonsec
Tree-Type overview looks very familiar to most users, might seem complicated at first sight, it gives fast access to all modalities of the editor	nonsec
An important usability requirement with respect to the UI-Editor is the WYSIWYG layout using the Windows Guidelines.	nonsec
The hardware layout is always visible during development.	nonsec
But, this layout is now very static, it does not provide the ability to modify the layout (e.g. button layout) towards the real application.	nonsec
Also derived Vetronics products, with different housing, LCD, ... are not covered.	nonsec
Communication ports are statically implemented into the editor. When new hardware is available, a lot of additional implementation work has to be done to support the hardware (e.g. CAN-bus, USB, ...).	nonsec
The complete UI-Editor has to be updated if modifications are made.	nonsec
This is an anomaly when we want to give support/updates via the Internet.	nonsec
Finally we concluded that the prototype met its functional requirements, but it was too static.	nonsec
From our hardware development and customer requirements we had learned that all have very specific needs concerning not only on User Interface but also real Hardware Interfacing to several peripherals.	nonsec
So we must be able to support this wide (and growing) range of interfacing capabilities of our Vetronics hardware in our UI-Editor as kind of Plug-Ins.	nonsec

Faults in the communication system shall not cause malfunction of an individual wind turbine.	nonsec
The system shall be designed in a way that faults of a sub-system interferes as little as possible with functions of the communi- cation system as a whole.	nonsec
In designing the system it shall be taken into account, that the physical environment at the plant typically has a wide span of temperature, moisture, salinity and vibration levels.	nonsec
Secondary systems may be for example Beacons (sea and air), Fire protection, Emergency alarm, Intruder alarm, Power supplies and emergency power systems, Meteorological sta- tions, Safety systems for personnel, Data logger systems and Condition monitoring.	nonsec

The values shall be available for display on operator HMI as well as for storage (databases).	nonsec
Updating of values shall be selectable down to an interval of 1 sec.	nonsec
All data must be stored in the plant controller for transmission on demand.	nonsec

As stated in Section 2.2 the main objective for the communication system is to transfer data to and from the process/plant level.	nonsec
The overall purpose is to support the functions described in Section 4.	nonsec
In order to accomplish this the basic services of the communication system shall include the following: Connection establishment and release. Authentication. Identification of functional object and devices. Data access and transfer. Reliable communication over a network.	nonsec
Data can be transferred according to one of the following principles: A. Periodic data transfer (all data or only data that has changed since last transfer), B. Data transfer on demand, C. Event driven (spontaneuos) data transfer, D. Command transfer, E. Set point transfer.	nonsec
The following kinds of data need to be supported: I. Measurements/analogue data (signals) from the wind power plant, II. Set points sent to the wind power plant, III. Binary Signals/Status data from the wind power plant, IV. Binary control commands to the wind power plant, V. Alarms, VI. Events, VII. Counters, VIII. Timers, IX.Data structures, X. Time series data, XI. Short text messages, XII. Flat files.	nonsec
Data are either polled at the node (the wind turbine) or periodic and automatic sent out from the node (periodic broadcast and event driven transfer).	nonsec
The important requirement is the ‘scanning rate’ (maximum delay).	nonsec
Historical data, counter’s and log’s are transferred on demand (a request is sent to the wind turbine and the information is send back).	nonsec
Alarm data shall be sent from the wind turbine on occurrence.	nonsec
Setting data in the wind turbine and giving orders to the wind turbine are sent to the wind turbine when needed.	nonsec
It should be possible to time stamp all data.	nonsec
Time stamped data shall be stamped with ‘last updated date + time’ (UTC time).	nonsec
The accuracy and resolution of the timestamp should be at least 10 ms.	nonsec
All analogue measured values should have readable properties like ‘signal quality’ and ‘scanning rate’.	nonsec
This information does not have to be included with every data transfer.	nonsec
The averaging time and the measuring and averaging method should be documented for all data.	nonsec
It should be possible to group both analogue and binary values so they can be read in a single transaction.	nonsec
Remote monitoring and operation of devices requires strict security measures for several rea- sons.	sec
To protect the data from being stolen, corrupted, and intentionally falsified, to protect the device from unauthorised use or to preserve the privacy of monitoring data.	sec
To enforce these security requirements the following functionality is needed: Authentication, Data Integrity and Data Confidentiality.	sec
Server authentication shall ensure the client application that it is truly operating on the in- tended site.	sec
Client authentication ensures that an authorised client/operator is operating the equipment.	sec
The rights for each user to operate functions and to see data on different levels in the object hierarchy might be necessary to set.	sec
In that way all users can have relevant access to the sys- tem and get updated information from the wind power plants.	sec
Non-corruption of data transferred is necessary, i.e. the ability of a communication system to deliver data from its originator to its destination with an acceptable residual error rate.	sec
This prevents both malicious and false operation.	sec
Data items transferred might need to be encrypted to prevent both malicious and false opera- tion, as well as eavesdropping.	sec
The response times of most operational functions and, therefore, of the related communication does not need to be much faster than one second (human time scale).	nonsec
System management functions, which shall be available for the operators and control systems, are of low time criti- cal nature.	nonsec
Delay in execution of these functions however should not be more than 2 seconds.	nonsec
Regarding safety of persons, plant and electric network, the communication system shall not be of critical nature.	nonsec
No functions regarding safety of persons shall be based on the communi- cation system.	nonsec
No functions regarding safety of plant and electrical network shall be based on the communication system – all safety functions must be self-contained in the process or in the devices where systems interface and will trip automatically.	nonsec
In situations where the com- munication system is completely inaccessible, the plant may be forced to a shutdown by al- ternative means.	nonsec
Regarding optimisation of the operation, the communication system has a major role.	nonsec
The time critical functions include both control and supervision functions.	nonsec
Set points for power control and Start and Stop commands are the most time critical functions, but also a prompt response (Acknowledge-on-receive) is important.	nonsec
Periodic on-line operational data is essen- tial for the optimisation of the operation.	nonsec
Finally the operator need to know the status of the communication system to be able to rely on the presented data.	nonsec
The time critical functions shall use short messages with a high priority.	nonsec
Data-wise the mes- sages shall be small and shall be transmitted with a minimum of delay.	nonsec
Delays may occur due to transmission errors, low capacity or low bandwidth of the transport media or network faults.	nonsec
It is essential for the proper design of the communication system to select methods that minimise such properties.	nonsec
Time critical functions must be based on fast and reliable transmission of a number of se- lected data types.	nonsec
An example of a typical requirement regarding delays for these data is as follows:“The overall transfer time for services in time critical functions shall not be more than 0,5 seconds.”	nonsec
Reliability in the sense that data can be retransmitted, reconstructed, or reprocessed if lost or inaccessible of some reason is essential.	nonsec
Data may be inaccessible e.g. because of faults in the process (plant), faults in data transport or faults in data processing units.	nonsec
For most data it must be possible to restore information, including the sequence of events.	nonsec
Local procedures for recovery may incorporate redundancy of selected functions and backup of data.	nonsec
The commu- nication system shall include functionality to transfer stored data to central storage and proc- essing after restoration of the communication.	nonsec
To prevent interruptions in the data transfer, the communication system shall allow for redun- dant communication channels.	nonsec
Processing of data may be carried out simultaneously on more units.	nonsec
Automatic procedures for detection of communication faults and for managing redun- dancy of system components shall be established.	nonsec
The physical transport media should possi- bly be redundant to a certain degree depending on the conditions at the specific plant.	nonsec
There must be a way for existing plants to interface to a new communication system.	nonsec
The expected solution to interface systems using proprietary methods for communication, e.g. manufacturer-specified protocols or customer-specified protocols, to new communication systems is to use gateways.	nonsec

The GUI shall run on Windows 2000, Sun Solaris 8, and Linux operating systems without modification of the Java code.	nonsec
The system shall be implemented in the Java 1.3 programming language.	nonsec
One algorithm for displaying an SDT has been implemented and found to be unacceptable: Draw SDT into large virtual window with a smaller viewing area, Zoom in on portions of the tree.	nonsec
Should be able to enforce resource allocations according to user-centric priorities.	nonsec
Should be dynamic, and not static, which is a necessary implication of the user-centric approach, so that users who need their jobs completed in emergency and are willing to pay a high price for it, are able to get their job done through dynamic reallocation of resources even if the job is submitted later than other jobs or the system is heavily loaded.	nonsec
Hence, the scheduler should be able to change resource limits, priorities, privileges and execution order of the submitted jobs.	nonsec
Should be scalable, which means that its performance should not degrade with the addition of nodes and jobs to the cluster.	nonsec
Should be configurable, and allow for various scheduling policies that can be modified to incorporate QoS parameters.	nonsec
Should be separable from the cluster management system.	nonsec
Should provide administrative security.	nonsec
Should provide at least a basic level of job accounting, to aid in scheduling policies.	nonsec
Should ideally provide a GUI for all components, such as for users to submit jobs and for administrators to oversee scheduling.	nonsec
This functional feature deals with the end-user (can also be used by the administrator) and is facilitated by the interface of the AUTHOR \* MERGEFORMAT Sun Grid Engine cluster management system.	nonsec
Hence, it is linked to the scheduler, but does not interface directly with the scheduler. However, the SGE interface will need to be adapted to include additional submission parameters that a user needs to be submit, which are not already supported by SGE.	nonsec
This may alternately be done through a command-line interface.	nonsec
User Information – relevant user data such as name and authentication id that needs to be used to submit a job to the cluster.	nonsec
Job Information – about the job that the user wants to submit, as well as already pending jobs, to determine whether the cluster can accept more jobs and can cater to the particular user job. The job details are provided in the functional feature Initialize Job.	nonsec
Cluster Information – Cluster Type and Scheduling mechanism details, Current Load Status, Submission Directions and Criteria.	nonsec
The cluster decides whether it is even open for job submissions, and whether the user that is trying to submit job is a valid user or not.	nonsec
This decision is different from the Accept/Reject Job feature described later on, which deals with the situation when the cluster is open for job submissions, but will decide on whether to accept or reject a job based on job parameters such as budget provided and deadline specified.	nonsec
Boolean – Whether the cluster is accepting submission or not. Boolean – User verified or not.	nonsec
This feature will allow the user or administrator to view details about the job that have been submitted, and the progress of the execution of the job.	nonsec
User Id and Password – to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to see the job status	nonsec
Show the user the available options about the submitted job, and information about the progress of job execution. Process selected options if choices are provided to the user to view different aspects of job information.	nonsec
User view of available options about jobs submitted by the user.	nonsec
This feature may be available to both the user and the administrator, to cancel a job or under specific circumstances, change a job parameter.	nonsec
Parameters such as deadline and cost are crucial to the job scheduling and would not normally be changeable. However, if the user wishes to specify a different output directory or a delayed deadline, this may be permitted.	nonsec
User Id and Password – to ensure that only the appropriate user is able to delete/change the job.	nonsec
Remove job from the queue and update cluster status. Revise scheduling decisions about resource allocation to pending jobs and submission of new jobs.	nonsec
Updated cluster information and scheduling decision – CPU load, node status, queue length, quanta allocated to pending jobs, revised expected finishing deadline of pending jobs. These outputs are facilitated by the functionality of the AUTHOR \* MERGEFORMAT Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, and are not independently produced by the Libra scheduler.	nonsec
This is a main functional requirement that prepares the scheduler for eventually scheduling and executing a job.	nonsec
The Libra scheduler performs it once a job has been accepted by SGE, with information from the scheduler.	nonsec
The information submitted by the user about the job, as well as the job id assigned by SGE.	nonsec
Two processes are performed as part of this function: the details of the job are retrieved and then these details are set in variables that represent the state of the cluster and its queues. The parsed parameters are passed on to the scheduling module where the job may be accepted or rejected.	nonsec
The output comprises the set variables that represent job information submitted with a job. Hence, the exact job details are output: Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.	nonsec
This is the function that is responsible for determining the possibility of satisfying the user, given his budget and deadline. Hence, the most important inputs are budget, deadline, and execution time, to determine whether the job can be accepted or not.	nonsec
Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.	nonsec
Cluster information – CPU load, node status, remaining time of pending jobs.	nonsec
Based on the job parameters, the scheduler figures out a priority of the job that reflects the share of CPU time that it deserves and needs according to the specified criteria. The scheduler determines whether the job can be finished by the requisite deadline, given the execution time of the job and the execution status of other pending jobs on various nodes.	nonsec
The output includes a boolean value specifying whether the job has been accepted or rejected.	nonsec
A suggested deadline or cost is given to the user, as a precondition for the job to be accepted.	nonsec
This is the feature of Libra that decides how the job will be scheduled based on its budget and deadline. It uses the Stride Scheduling Algorithm to enforce resource allocations (CPU cycles) proportional to a user’s budget and deadline. It is performed by Libra once it has decided that a job can be accommodated.	nonsec
Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.	nonsec
Allocate tickets to a job based on its budget and deadline and the budget and deadlines of all other jobs on the execution host under debate. Calculate the stride and the pass of the job, where the stride is simply the global stride constant divided by the tickets and the pass is initially just the stride.	nonsec
Scheduling information – the job’s tickets, stride and pass.	nonsec
This feature decides on which node and on which queue the job will be placed for execution. It is done on the basis of the job’s budget, execution time and deadline.	nonsec
Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.	nonsec
Cluster Information - CPU Load, Node Status, Remaining Time of Pending Jobs, Available Memory	nonsec
Libra first looks at the load on each of the hosts and sorts them in ascending order, choosing the host that is least loaded.	nonsec
This ensures that load balancing is taken care of.	nonsec
It then selects the appropriate queue based on whether the job is sequential or embarrassingly parallel, budget, etc…	nonsec
The chosen execution host and queue.	nonsec
This feature takes the job and inserts it into the queue on the execution host that the scheduler had previously decided it is to be placed in. This is a separate feature since the job may be able to wait for a while before it is given CPU time, allowing other jobs to complete or be scheduled earlier if their deadlines are more urgent. Thus, the dispatcher decides when to actually send the job for execution.	nonsec
The chosen execution host and queue on which to place the job for execution.	nonsec
The scheduler sends the job to the appropriate queue and it joins the competition for resources.	nonsec
The scheduled job in its appropriate host and queue.	nonsec
Every time a job is scheduled for execution on a host, this feature of Libra updates the cluster status. This action is also performed when a job ends and is removed from the cluster.	nonsec
Job details – Job Id, Job type, Standalone Execution time, Location of executable and input data sets, System Type, Budget, Deadline.	nonsec
Chosen execution host and queue.	nonsec
Libra first reserves the amount of resources that will be required by the job on the node. It then updates the execution host queue status and sends that information about the additional load on the queue and node under consideration to the central information store on the master host.	nonsec
There is no output associated with this feature as it simply performs an update and does not send any results back. It is a trigger that is activated every time a job is scheduled or is deleted from an execution host.	nonsec
As long as there are jobs in the queues, this feature is being run. It essentially decides how to time-slice between all the jobs currently being executed. These scheduling decisions are made based on the stride-scheduling algorithm.	nonsec
Scheduled Job – job details and the queue and node on which that job is scheduled to run.	nonsec
Scheduling Information – the job’s tickets, stride and pass.	nonsec
It looks at all the jobs on the cluster and selects the one with the minimum pass value, and allots it a quantum. The pass of that job is then advanced by its stride. In case of a tie, the arbitrary FIFO job ordering is used. This loop is repeated until there are no jobs left to run on a queue.	nonsec
Updated Cluster Information - CPU Load, Node Status, Remaining Time of Pending Jobs, Available Memory	nonsec
The scheduler will not support job migration for the purpose of decreasing resource fragmentation.	nonsec
There will be a maximum of 1 bug/KLOC.	nonsec
In case of system outage, the cluster will be down while the Linux operating system boots up. This will take less than five minutes.	nonsec
The Libra scheduler will ensure the privacy of user job status and ensure full control over job execution, so that alteration of scheduling criteria or actual resource allocation is not possible without administrator authority.	nonsec
The maximum response time for the submission of a job will be 1 minute.	nonsec
The maximum number of jobs schedulable is limited only by the capacity of the nodes to fulfill the jobs’ deadlines; there is no upper limit inherent in the Libra scheduler as such.	nonsec
Assuming submitted statistics for jobs are accurate, the Libra scheduler will ensure that all jobs are completed with a 10% error allowance.	nonsec
Under all circumstances, the maximum cost payable as submitted by the user will be the maximum cost charged to the user.	nonsec
All code will be written as specified by the Hungarian Naming Convention.	nonsec
All code will be written as required by the GNU General Purpose License.	nonsec
The Libra scheduler will be a sub-component of SGE.	nonsec
All coding will be done in standard C.	nonsec
Exhaustive searches of the entire set of combinations of jobs will not be done. Heuristics will be developed for this scheduling problem.	nonsec
There will be two user types – the cluster user and the cluster administrator – each of which will have its own corresponding interface.	nonsec
The minimal requirements are that the cluster user would be able to interact with the system through the Linux command prompt, or through the interface provided by the AUTHOR \* MERGEFORMAT Sun Grid Engine cluster management system.	nonsec
There will be a different command for each of the following actions: submit jobs with the associated deadline, cost, and execution time; query the cluster to establish the current cost per unit time for submitting new jobs; monitor the status of submitted jobs; cancel jobs submitted by him; check his credit balance; check his usage history.	nonsec
The minimal requirements are that the cluster administrator will be able to interact with the system through the Linux command prompt, or through the interface provided by the Sun Grid Engine cluster management system.	nonsec
In addition to the commands available to the user, additional commands will allow the administrator to: check the status of each node of the cluster, check the usage pattern history of the cluster, check the status of all submitted jobs, check the load on each node of the cluster, alter the cost structure of the cluster, alter the scheduling policy of the cluster, cancel, suspend, and resume any job.	nonsec
All hardware interfaces of Libra will be those of the Sun Grid Engine on top of which it will be running. Hence, it will incorporate SGE’s interfaces for: CPU usage, Memory usage, Swap file creation, Network communication.	nonsec
Libra will directly interface with the modified AUTHOR \* MERGEFORMAT Sun Grid Engine cluster management system, version 5.3. SGE in turn will be interfacing with the operating system and any other software components it requires. For the execution of embarrassingly parallel jobs, the PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) and MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries will be used by the cluster.	nonsec
Libra will utilize the communications architecture of Sun Grid Engine itself, and will not have any unique communications interfaces above of SGE.	nonsec

NPAC SMS shall allow NPAC personnel to create billing reports for all Service Provider usage. For all report types in R11-9 and R11-10, the NPAC personnel will be able to specify whether the report is an aggregation/summary of stored data or a detailed report containing every item stored for the report type.	nonsec
NPAC SMS shall allow Service Providers to gather billing report data on only their NPAC SMS usage. Service Providers will not be able to create reports on any other Service Provider’s usage. For all report types in R11-9 and R11-10, the NPAC SMS shall create an aggregation/summary of stored data for the report type.	nonsec

The NPAC billing system shall be accessible only to NPAC personnel.	nonsec
The system should provide a categorized view of the entire inventory to the Construction Junction staff.	nonsec
Starting at the department level, users can navigate into the inventory item categories and sub- categories, all the way down to an individual inventory item.	nonsec
The system should allow inventory administrators to customize the inventory structure by defining the inventory departments (not to be confused actual retail floor departments known later in this document as stocking locations).	nonsec
The system should allow inventory administrators to customize the attributes and details available for each inventory item.	nonsec
Attributes can be defined for each department, and details can be defined for each department and/or category.	nonsec
Items are typically added to the inventory as part of the donation processes.	nonsec
This is called adding an item in donation processing.	nonsec
Alternatively, items can be added during routine inventory maintenance. This is called adding an item in inventory management mode.	nonsec
The system should allow various management actions to be performed on items existing in the inventory.	nonsec
These include modifying, deleting and splitting an item, and viewing the item‟s details and item history.	nonsec
These actions are only available for Unique and Stock items.	nonsec
The system should assist in the task of pricing a new inventory item by making pricing suggestions to the user when adding to or modifying an item in the inventory.	nonsec
The suggested prices should be calculated based on the original and sale prices of similar items that currently exist or existed in the inventory in the past.	nonsec
Acquisition records for Drop-Off, Pickup and Decon donations are created in the CRM system.	nonsec
Inventory Management users should be able to view all past and current acquisitions.	nonsec
Receiving Associates use this function to locate an expected acquisition when receiving a donation at the loading dock.	nonsec
Pickup and Decon crews may also use this function to initiate the process of receiving items while in the truck, on their way to the receiving dock.	nonsec
Drop Off acquisitions are not typically pre-scheduled as Pick Up and Decon acquisitions except for those submitted through the organizational website.	nonsec
As such, when a donor arrives with an unexpected drop off donation, a new acquisition needs to be able to be created in the CRM system first, at either the customer service desk or at the dock, before it can be viewed in the acquisitions screen.	nonsec
A donor in possession of a valid acquisition number can proceed to the receiving dock where the items to be donated will be received and processed, and a donation receipt will be generated.	nonsec
Alternatively, a donor may go directly to the receiving dock, in which case a new acquisition is created by the Receiving Associate before items can be received and processed.	nonsec
The screens used for the acquisition process should simplify and expedite the data entry process, allowing the Receiving Associate to enter only the information needed to generate the donation receipt.	nonsec
Additional attributes needed to complete the item information and effectively add the item to the inventory can be added at a second step, after the receipt has been printed and the donor has been served.	nonsec
The Receiving Associate can print temporary acquisition labels for items that require further processing.	nonsec
Pick Up and Decon crews may also initiate the receiving process, entering as much detailed information about the donated items as desired, and generating a donation receipt.	nonsec
They cannot, however, add items to the inventory or complete the acquisition process.	nonsec
A Receiving Associate is required to review all the acquisition information before those actions can take place.	nonsec
Any item in the inventory may be purchased by a Construction Junction customer.	nonsec
The sale of the item is processed by QuickBooks POS and the inventory must be updated accordingly.	nonsec
The application will provide a reporting mechanism that, at a minimum, allows Construction Junction to review and report by inventory, inventory type, donor contact information, and the ability to link inventory to individual that donated it.	nonsec
The system should integrate with Construction Junction‟s website and allow, in addition to capacity outlined in later sections, the ability for customers to view and search CJ‟s inventory online.	nonsec
The item search can be done in two ways: The user may „drill down‟ to a particular category using the hierarchical inventory view displayed on the website, The user may perform a search for items by keyword (basic search) and other parameters such as price, date received and/or discount (advanced search).	nonsec
The „Shop‟ page on CJ‟s website provides a starting concept of what the categorized inventory search might look like as does the website at www.seconduse.com.	nonsec
„Contact Us‟ and „Online Donation Form‟ website pages should integrate with Salesforce and allow donors to upload images.	nonsec
The system should also include the implementation of Salesforce.com Ideas on CJ‟s „Recycling & Resources‟ webpage to allow for crowd sourcing the best recycling options for various materials in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.	nonsec
A „blastworthy‟ flag already exists on the item entry and update screens.	nonsec
That field can be used to flag an item for inclusion on the next e-Blast.	nonsec
When an item is flagged for e-Blast, the system should verify that a stocking location has been set for the item.	nonsec
The system should allow Construction Junction staff to view a list of all items that are currently flagged as blastworthy that haven‟t yet been included in an e-Blast.	nonsec
The user can then select which flagged items should be included on the next e-Blast.	nonsec
The system should also provide an e-Blast preview screen that displays all items selected for that week‟s e-Blast, and also all items that have been flagged but not selected.	nonsec
A cart with a laptop, camera and bar code reader will be used by the Construction Junction staff when looking for items in the sales floor that should be e-Blasted. That allows the user to quickly locate an item in the inventory by scanning its tag, flag items that aren‟t yet flagged and enter additional item information prior to the e-Blast.	nonsec
The system should integrate with Vertical Response (or its future possible replacement, Exact Target) for the e-Blast email notifications.	nonsec
The system should also allow Construction Junction staff to view a list of all items that were included in previous week‟s e-Blast and that have been sold. The user can then select the items that should be included in the „Great and Gone‟ section of the website. The system should also allow the user to select any sold items, adding pictures as needed, to be included in the „Great and Gone‟ section, even if they were not part of previous week‟s e-Blast. „Great and Gone‟ items should have a “Sold” overlay over their associated images.	nonsec
Items should be able to be re-Blasted without affecting previous e-Blast versions.	nonsec
The website should present an „Add to Cart‟ button on search results and item detail screens and standard „View Shopping Cart‟ and checkout functionality as well as the option to „forward item to a friend‟.	nonsec
The system does not need to support shipping options. All items purchased have to be picked up at the Construction Junction site.	nonsec
Only items flagged as available for online purchase on the inventory system can be purchased online.	nonsec
Those items are held in a separate area in the warehouse designated for online items and can only be purchased online.	nonsec
For items that are not available for online purchase the website should display a comment that reads 'You can purchase this item over the phone or at Construction Junction'.	nonsec
When an item is purchased over the phone it is physically moved to the SOLD items area in the warehouse, but should remain on the website for an additional 15 days with “Sold” appearing across the item name and image.	nonsec
Once registered online, the system should allow Construction Junction staff to print out a member card (possibly via QuickBooks POS) containing the member‟s name and unique member ID, in both numeric and bar code format.	nonsec
The member card can be scanned by Construction Junction staff to quickly identify the member when donating or purchasing items. The member‟s email address and associated customer ID/barcode should uniquely identity the member in both QuickBooks POS and in the CRM system.	nonsec
The system should allow Construction Junction to reward customers for frequent donating by giving them in-store credit that can be used when purchasing items.	nonsec
The „Reuse Reward‟ amount credited for each donated item should be kept separate from store credit for returned merchandise and be calculated as follows: For stock items, credited when the item is received, and calculated as 0.5% of the stock item‟s pre-defined price, For unique items, credited only the item is sold, and calculated as 1% of the price the item was actually sold for.	nonsec
The system should also provide reports that show all items a particular donor brought in and how much those items were sold for.	nonsec
QuickBooks POS should be aware of the current amount of credit accrued by a member so that it can be used whenever the member wants to purchase an item. Users should be able to use their accrued balance to buy gift certificates and give them to someone else.	nonsec
The system should be able to print the donor‟s current credit amount on the donation receipt.	nonsec
QuickBooks POS should also print a message on the sales and donation receipt informing customers that they can earn rewards by donating to Construction Junction.	nonsec
Additional membership benefits should include: Signing up for CJ‟s weekly e-Blast (all users who sign up for the e-Blast are automatically members and all users who sign up to be members automatically receive the weekly e- Blast (unless they manually uncheck that option)), Ability to manage online profile including status of e-Blast subscription, donation addresses, view sales history, donation history and re-reprint donation receipts online, Ability to have insight into the type of items scheduled for pickup by CJ, Automatic notification when accumulated credits reach a certain self-defined threshold. Ability to create a public green business or service listing, Ability to upload images and video of their reuse project(s), Advance notification of new class offerings and upcoming events, Easier purchasing of items offered online and automatic pre-registration for online auctions, Option to purchase CJ gift cards at a slightly discounted rate, Bonus in store discounts on member‟s birthday, Allows faster completion of online donation form and allows user to view and request available slots in CJ‟s pickup schedule.	nonsec
Construction Junction website users should be able to select a particular item category in the inventory (via an inventory or e-Blast view) and add it to their wish list.	nonsec
Users should also be able to add to the wish list any of the categories for items returned as search results.	nonsec
Anytime a new item is received into the inventory in that category, an automated notification is then sent to the user.	nonsec
The notification can be in multiple forms such as an email message, text message, voice blast, Twitter or Facebook.	nonsec
That option is set by the user in his/her website account settings.	nonsec
That means that in order to take advantage of the wish list functionality, the user must be registered as a Construction Junction website member.	nonsec
Customer Service representatives should also be able to add to a customer‟s wish list when requested by him/her at the customer service desk or via email phone, etc..	nonsec
Users should be able to view their current wish line online and remove entries from it.	nonsec
Users should also be able to add to their wish lists the categories of items that have been sold over the past 15 days.	nonsec
That means that once an item is sold, it should still be listed on the website for a period of 15 days, and its listing should contain the „SOLD‟ word on it.	nonsec
The item entry and update screens should include a „Subject to Aging Discount‟ flag.	nonsec
The system should use that flag to automatically generate discounts for items based on the amount of time they have been in the inventory.	nonsec
The discount should be calculated as a 10% discount for each month that the item has been in the inventory, and the item label should display the discounted prices and their corresponding date periods.	nonsec
The aging starts on the date when the item is assigned a price and is effectively added to the inventory, and not when the item is received.	nonsec
QuickBooks POS should apply the correct discount for the current date when an item is sold, and the website should automatically display the correct discount for the current date (requires regular data transfer).	nonsec
The sold item should be able to be viewed in Salesforce and flagged as „stored on-site‟ with an automatic „pick up date‟ calculated for seven days out. Staff can print a sold tag that is affixed to the sold item.	nonsec
Automatic emails are sent to the customer as required pick-up dates approach and the status of items is updated as they are picked up.	nonsec
Tasks are generated for staff to return overdue items to the sales floor and apply the appropriate store credit to customer accounts for items that have not been picked up within the allotted seven day period.	nonsec
This puts the item back into inventory and affects customer store credit accounts.	nonsec
The system must allow a threshold quantity to be set at any level (department or category) in the inventory. Once that threshold is reached for a department or category, the corresponding matrix cell should change to a different color that indicates the overstock condition.	nonsec
Also, the current quantity on hand and the threshold value for the item‟s department or category should be displayed on the item entry and update screens.	nonsec
This information should also be displayed on a different color or layout when the threshold is reached.	nonsec
The system should still allow items to be received for a department or category that is overstocked, but Construction Junction staff may decide to turn down those items at the receiving dock.	nonsec
The system should also provide a report that shows currently overstock departments and categories.	nonsec
Based on the overstock report Construction Junction staff may decide to put the entire category on sale for a period of time, or until the category is no longer overstocked.	nonsec
As the discount is only temporary, the item prices should not be changed in the Inventory.	nonsec
However, the price discount should be automatically applied on purchases via QuickBooks POS, and should also be visible on the website.	nonsec
The mobile units should allow that all inventory screens can be displayed and used in the same fashion as in the fixed workstations.	nonsec
This eliminates the need for designing a second set of screens to be used on mobile units with limited display capabilities.	nonsec
The Inventory Item entry screen already provides a comments/history text field that can be used for the purpose described.	nonsec
In addition to that, the system should be able to generate and print signage containing the item history, back story information and other item details. Ideally, the system would provide a few pre- defined formats for signage that can be chosen from.	nonsec
The described functionality is being implemented as part of the CRM project.	nonsec
In addition, the Inventory Management System needs to store item weight information and generate reports that indicate the total weight received, sold and diverted from landfills.	nonsec
When the actual item weight is not indicated, the system should use a pre-set average weight for the item category.	nonsec
The system should also display the actual weight average for the category on the category configuration screen, and also the number of items used when calculating that average.	nonsec
The inventory administrator can then decide whether to configure the category to use the actual average weight or a pre-set average weight, which would be set manually.	nonsec
The described functionality, which ranks the donor in terms of ease of working with, is being implemented as part of the CRM project.	nonsec
Construction Junction would also like to be able to generate the following donor statistics, which could be implemented in the form of reports: Number/value/volume of donations per donor, Fastest selling donations / time to sell per donor, Value retention of items (sold x estimated price) per donor Overall donor rating.	nonsec
The application is expected to operate via touch screen user interfaces, and take advantage of that technology to be as fast, efficient, intuitive, and flexible as possible while also minimizing the potential for errors and duplications.	nonsec
It should minimize the use of keyboard and mouse when processing acquisitions, and should allow acquisitions to be completed with few clicks and page switches.	nonsec
For internal users: Donation/acquisition processing - The system must be available during normal Construction Junction operating hours, Sales processing - The system must be available during normal Construction Junction operating hours, Inventory management - The system must be available beyond normal operating hours to accommodate inventory management operations.	nonsec
For external users - The system must be available beyond normal operating hours to accommodate website use – Inventory listing, wish list management and online purchases.	nonsec
Access to the application by the Construction Junction staff must require user login. Access to application screens and functions is granted or denied based on the profile and role of the currently logged in user, as detailed in the preceding use-case requirements.	sec
The system should record changes to application entities in the form of „created user/time‟, „modified user/time‟ fields.	sec
The system should also record information about various sensitive inventory management operations such as deleting items and changing the price of items.	sec
The functionality provided by the Inventory Management System will be critical to the normal operation of the Construction Junction business.	nonsec
As such, the system should perform with consistently and predictably low response times in order not to impact the performance or the timely execution of the various tasks that need to be conducted by the Construction Junction staff.	nonsec
A web browser-based interface must be provided for all the Inventory Management functionality.	nonsec
This sections lists the screens required and associated UI requirements.	nonsec
The following are specific UI requirements for the entire Inventory Management application: Buttons and shortcuts should be easy to click on a touch screen workstation. Extra spacing between rows should be added if necessary, All required information fields should be marked with an asterisk (*), During data validation, all validation errors must be reported to the actor and displayed on the screen, In case of a validation error, the actor must not have to re-enter the values that are valid.	nonsec
The system should support the following hardware interfaces: Touch screen monitors – To facilitate navigation of the categorized inventory when processing acquisitions and also for normal inventory maintenance tasks, Bar code readers – For scanning item labels and member cards, Zebra printers – For quick printing of item labels, Standard, color laser printers – For printing donation receipts, item signage and reports Mobile devices.	nonsec

The API should be flexible enough to allow external tools such as JHOVE, DROID to be used for file format identification.	nonsec
The ARC to WARC migration should be able to run on multiple machines that will be easy to deploy.	nonsec
This may be achieved by using a simple messaging infrastructure.	nonsec
Logging during the migration may be turned on/off at any time .	nonsec
Software checkpoints (such as start-trans, end-trans) may be added during processing for managing atomic transactions (e.g., operations on a file, these must start and complete to be accepted in the migration), except where operating system limitations would prohibit it.	nonsec
It shall be possible to perform a “dry-run migration”. That is, a blank conversion to generate useful reports (performance issues, bad ARCs, time estimation ...) without writing real WARC data (i.e. simulating only). Dry run is defined entirely by the configuration.	nonsec
Deduplication may be run before migration, inside a batch process.	nonsec
Duplicate detection shall find and report WARC records with the same checksums.	nonsec
A centralised database will be used to store previously processed records, against which new ones will be compared.	nonsec
To validate that the migration succeeded, arc_warc_verify will use the METADATA included in the newly generated WARC files to match records with their corresponding ARC files (see FR4, and FR5).	nonsec
Core validation shall use payload checksum comparisons.	nonsec
Sampling will be provided where applicable to quickly validate the conversions (FR 15.1 and FR 18 for example).	nonsec

Data is required to be emailed as an xml document attached to an email with a standard Subject header and sent to the email address of the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system.	nonsec
The subject header must consist of a character string containing ‘ERS – ‘ prefixed to the contents of the GBRRN attribute of the Electronic Logbook data being transmitted. The GBRRN attribute is defined in the UK XML/XSD.	nonsec
The GBRRN attribute is defined uniquely as the vessels’ RSS Number appended to the current date (in YYYYMMDD format) and a 6 digit sequence number, e.g. RSSNumber+YYYYMMDD+999999. An example of the contents of an email subject could be ERS – A1234520090623000001.	nonsec
The xml document file name should be based upon the GBRRN attribute defined in the UK XML/XSD. An example of this format could be A1234520090623000001.	nonsec
The RSS Number will require to be padded with trailing X’s to ensure that it is always 6 characters in length.	nonsec
Each file should have the suffix of .xml, e.g. A1234520090623000001.xml.	nonsec
All xml documents attached to emails to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system must be encrypted using PGP.	nonsec
It is recognised that communications methods, other than email, are available for data transmission.	nonsec
If an alternative is proposed, this should be advised to the Validation Authority and if feasible and practicable the UK Fisheries Administrations will endeavour to extend their ERS system to accommodate alternative methods.	nonsec
The ELSS must permit the Master of the vessel to generate formatted data for transmission to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system.	nonsec
There are 2 categories of transmission, those that must be generated automatically by the ELSS and those that can be generated and transmitted under the control of the Master of the vessel.	nonsec
The ELSS must provide facilities to capture and deliver for transmission corrections to previously successfully transmitted data.	nonsec
Data corrections must not be transmitted piecemeal; the entire report containing one or more corrected items must be transmitted.	nonsec
There is no requirement to identify the data items that have been corrected in the generated corrected report.	nonsec
All corrections must be easily identifiable within the ELSS user interface.	nonsec
The ELSS must only permit correction messages to be generated and sent for reports sent during a current trip up to the submission of the End of Fishing report for that voyage	nonsec

All requests should be made by contacting the Validation Authority by email in the first instance.	nonsec
Once operational the UK XML/XSD allows for a test message to be sent to the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system.	nonsec
This test facility must be used to send test transmissions to establish that the communications between the vessel and the UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system are fully operational.	nonsec
The UK fisheries administrations’ ERS system will acknowledge any test messages but will not store any data that has been transmitted.	nonsec
ELSS must retain all logbook reports and any corrections on the system at least until the end of each trip, i.e. on submission of the electronic landing declaration or of a transhipment report.	nonsec
Any ELSS software updates must not impact upon the ELSS’s ability to meet the requirements set out in this document and other test documentation .	nonsec
If it does then the product must be submitted for re-approval, and can not be deployed by fishing vessels until this is granted and the new version id is published on the UKFA web site lists	nonsec
One username/password must be provided for the owner of each vessel	sec
The owner is then able to set up subsidiary users such as the master of the vessel with their own username and password.	sec
The username is required to be recorded in each report completed and in each transmission made; the person who has entered the data is required to “sign” the Electronic Logbook data stating that they are aware of the responsibilities/liabilities they are committing to in completing and / or transmitting a report.	sec
Each copy of the ELSS installed must be provided with a unique (internal?) number that is automatically entered into each transmission to identify the instance of the ELSS from which the report has been transmitted.	sec

This is the first screen of the program that the user sees, and the part where most of the operations take place.	nonsec
On the top, there is the menu bar with each option (GParted, Edit, View, Device, Partition) corresponding to a set of actions you can perform on a disk.	nonsec
Under that, is a bar which contains the most common functions of the program.	nonsec
Then the selected drive’s partitions are presented in both graphical and detailed mode.	nonsec
Every time you try to edit in any way, any partition, a confirmation dialog appears which warns about the potential of data loss. You can either click Cancel or Apply.	nonsec
You can copy a partition, and then paste it on another existing one, whether it is formatted or not.	nonsec
This of course leads to loss of data.	nonsec
If that’s fine, click OK on the warning window that is being displayed.	nonsec
You can exit GParted at any time you wish, by clicking on Exit on the upper left corner of the desktop.	nonsec
You can select Reboot, Shutdown, or Logout. Make your choice and click OK.	nonsec
For the GParted Live to run, you will need a PC (regardless of its operating system, it can be Windows or Linux) or Mac, with or without an operating system.	nonsec
Since it is not a resource hungry program, it will run on most systems without a problem.	nonsec
A CD/DVD drive is necessary for the application to boot, or at least one USB port if you plan to use the USB version of GParted Live.	nonsec
Lastly, a functional standard keyboard and mouse is required.	nonsec
Supported device types: • Hard disks, • USB Flash drives, • External hard drives (USB – eSATA enclosures etc.), • IDE, SATA, RAID controllers and attached devices.	nonsec
As it has already been stated, GParted Live runs on every system, so it doesn’t need any specific software from the user’s side.	nonsec
However, GParted depends on some libraries and tools for its function.	nonsec
These packages are already pre‐included in the .iso image file you downloaded from GParted’s website. Please refer to 2.7 for more details on that matter.	nonsec
Before booting with GParted Live, you have to download the image file and then burn it to a cd.	nonsec
So, you need a cd/dvd burning suite compatible with your operating system.	nonsec
Although network or Internet communication is not obvious, it is available.	nonsec
You can configure your network adapter to work with GParted by typing in the Terminal: dhclient eth0.	nonsec
You can also use the ifconfig and route commands.	nonsec
Please remember to edit /etc/resolve.conf accordingly.	nonsec
This enables you to update and add new packages to GParted.	nonsec
apt‐get update and apt‐get install <package name> are the corresponding commands.	nonsec
As it has already been mentioned, GParted is not a resource hog and will run on almost every computer.	nonsec
Its functions and features are not computationally intensive.	nonsec
It does not require a powerful processor or graphics card, much RAM, or disk space, for both the install and Live version, and the program loads and runs fairly quick.	nonsec
The only real requirement is a CD/DVD drive or a USB port that is working properly.	nonsec
As it is stated with many warnings in the program, data loss is a serious possibility, if you are not careful, backup your data and/or use the program with extreme caution.	nonsec
It is obvious that when you deal with partition changes, you could lose all your data by human or application error. GParted comes with absolute no warranty and cannot be made responsible for any loss of data.	nonsec
GParted Live does not deal with any security or privacy issues, as it does not run from within an operating system.	sec
Every user has administrator rights and full access which are given from the start of the program, as you are logged in as root.	sec
The application provides a quite friendly user interface with its operations accessible from the menu bar and the main toolbar.	nonsec
An average or casual user should not find any problem using the program to perform at least its main functions.	nonsec
Interoperability is guaranteed since this program runs on both Mac and PC (Linux, Windows or other operating system).	nonsec
GParted is free software.	nonsec
You have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve GParted. You do not have to pay money to use GParted.	nonsec
GParted is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or (at your option) any later version.	nonsec

PDFsam runs on every platform where a Java Virtual Machine is available (requires a JVM version 1.6 or higher).	nonsec
It has been tested on various versions of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OS X.	nonsec
PDFsam is not a web application, so the network communication is only necessary to check for software updates.	nonsec
Furthermore, the system can check for updates whenever is requested by the user, or automatically when opening the application.	nonsec
In this way PDFsam will be always up-to-date with all new supported features and bug fixes.	nonsec
The application must ensure that it leaves untouched the input pdf files. No modification is allowed to these files.	nonsec
Moreover, the application should function even in cases of wrong data insertion or wrong settings. In case of error it should provide users with appropriate help messages.	nonsec
PDFsam does not introduce any security level, since the data it manages is not critical.	sec
The users in the application are all equal so there is not the need of any identity management level.	sec
This application provides a pleasant and user friendly graphical interface with relatively simple functions.	nonsec
Any user should be able to use PDFsam without any specific knowledge or experience by reading the user manuals (or the help messages that are embedded in the application).	nonsec
Users only need to provide some pdf documents and with just a few clicks they can perform any action.	nonsec

This program will run on any Internet-accessible computer with a web browser that supports JavaScript and Macromedia Flash 5.	nonsec
This software will be developed in Macromedia Flash and HTML.	nonsec
"This product requires a web browser capable of running the Flash plug-in, which has the system requirements specified here under the section ""Playback."""	nonsec
Otherwise, this product has no software interaction.	nonsec
Only one person can use a single instance of the product.	nonsec
The product will reside on the Internet so more than one user can access the product and download its content for use on their computer.	nonsec
The product will consist of Flash movies linked together to form a web-based game: there will be a small introductory movie (~200KB), a main enu movie (~100KB), and a main game movie (1-2MB).	nonsec
Due to the relatively small size of the introductory and main menu movies, they can be downloaded in approximately one minute with a modem connection.	nonsec
Because Flash movies do not have to be fully downloaded to play, the main game can be played within a few minutes with a regular modem connection to the Internet.	nonsec
The product will be as secure as the web browser that will run the product.	sec
The product will be available over the Internet via the S2S website.	nonsec
Reliability will be ensured by extensive testing by the team members and mentors, if available.	nonsec
Maintainability is a primary goal for this project.	nonsec
For example, using appropriate sub-scenes in the main Flash game to split up the code will allow for easy alteration at a later date.	nonsec

Since the readout registers are comprised of split-pixels, the readout registers have to be clocked twice (double-clocked) to shift out one pixel.	nonsec
To transfer an image from the Image Section to the Store Section, the Image Section and Store Section three-phase clocks must be clocked simultaneously 602 times.	nonsec
Establish a map which contains a bias for every CCD pixel will be subtracted from every image.	nonsec
Establish a map which contains a bias for every CCD column which will be subtracted from every row in Normal Timing Mode.	nonsec
The purpose of Image Mode is to centroid on the source, and to create an image until the count rate drops below 8500 counts per second.	nonsec

Сontinuously ramp the CCD bias voltages through all possible values.	nonsec
Commands must be sent to put XRT into different observation modes and produce telemetry.	nonsec
The design of the FSW must avoid any timeconsuming setup or configuration as part of its nominal operation.	nonsec
This may also have implications for the way in which large software loads are structured.	nonsec
The FSW design must structure its HK packets such that the 230-byte constraint is not violated.	nonsec
In addition, the HK rate should be optimized to help ensure that a HK packet can reasonably appear in the S/C frame at an acceptable rate.	nonsec
It is not clear whether this also has implication to memory dumps.	nonsec
The FSW may have to provide for small dump packets if going down the RT link, and larger ones if going to the Solid State Recorder (SSR).	nonsec
Any packet that must be processed by ITOS should not be segmented.	nonsec
Based on a meeting with Mike Rackley on 08/30/00, ITOS will be upgraded to reassemble packets, but it is not yet known when this capability will be implemented.	nonsec
This may also have impact on memory dump packets.	nonsec
The FSW cannot compress any packet that must be recognized and processed by ITOS.	nonsec
The EBX register serves as the global offset table base register for position-independent code.	nonsec
So this register should be excluded from normal code generation.	nonsec
In addition, register EBX should be saved in the stack.	nonsec
Moreover, 386 ABI notes that EBX, ESI, and EDI should be saved in the stack, for both PIC and PDC.	nonsec
All registers previously saved in stack (see above) should be resotred.	nonsec
Additionally, the program header PT_DYNAMIC should be updated.	nonsec
Finally, the dynamic array should be updated (i.e. DT_HASH, DT_STRTAB, DT_SYMTAB, DT_STRSZ, and DT_SYMENT).	nonsec
However, a shared object should contain single relocation table .rel.dyn.	nonsec
So the new function, say WriteDynRelocsSection(), is needed.	nonsec
This function should merge all relocations into single table.	nonsec
It should update .dynamic section as well (i.e. either DT_RELA, DT_RELASZ, DT_RELAENT or DT_REL, DT_RELSZ, DT_RELENT).	nonsec
When link editor encounters one of the following relocation types: R_386_GOT32, R_386_GOTOFF, R_386_GOTPC it should build the Global Offset Table.
	nonsec
Additionally wlink should process this relocation types according to 386 ABI.	nonsec
One should add support of these relocation types to both ORL and WLCore.	nonsec
For ORL, introduce new constants in orlglobl.h, e.g.: ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_32, ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_OFF, ORL_RELOC_TYPE_GOT_REL.	nonsec
Then extend the mapping between ELF and ORL (elflwlv.c).	nonsec
Then the mapping between ORL_ and FIX_ should be added to DoReloc(), objorl.c.	nonsec
Of course, new FIX_ constants are needed as well (obj2supp.h).	nonsec
Similarly, R_386_GOTOFF should be FIX_OFFSET_32.	nonsec
Of course, additional FIX_ flags are needed to distinguish them for further processing in obj2supp.c.	nonsec
At the end of first linker pass, we can create the .got section (i.e. segment in DGROUP).	nonsec
At this time, _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ symbol should be defined as well.	nonsec
For unresolved external symbols, GOT entries are needed as well.	nonsec
Linker should create R_386_GLOB_DAT relocations for such GOT entries.	nonsec
Finally, the dynamic array should be updated (PLTGOT).	nonsec
The GOT entry should be created for each PLT entry.	nonsec
Such GOT entry should contain the address of the following pushl instruction, not the real address of e.g. name1.	nonsec
A new R_386_JUMP_SLOT relocation should be created.	nonsec
When relocation R_386_PLT32 is encountered, the linker should create new PLT entry for the corresponding symbol (but only if its type is STT_FUNC).	nonsec
The corresponding ORL type, ORL_RELOC_TYPE_PLT_32, is already defined (but not implemented yet).	nonsec
This is relative type, so the mapping should include FIX_OFFSET_32 | FIX_REL.	nonsec
Note that the separated relocation section (.rel.plt) is needed for PLT relocations.	nonsec
This relocation table should also reside in the code segment	nonsec
Finally, the dynamic array should be updated (PLTRELSZ, PLTREL, and JMPREL).	nonsec
Some features related to shared objects are implemented as well.	nonsec
Thus wlink fails (i.e. Segmentation fault) when one tries to link a shared object.	nonsec
ORL should be reviewed and fixed in respective to these issues.	nonsec
"Additionally, the linker should collect the names of shared objects for further processing (see ""Needed Libraries"" below)."	nonsec
If this list is non-empty, the linker should perform some tasks described in the further sections.	nonsec
The additional program header PT_INTERP is needed for an executable that uses shared object(s).	nonsec
This segment type is meaningful only for executable files (though it may occur for shared objects); it may not occur more than once in a file.	nonsec
If it is present, it must precede any loadable segment entry.	nonsec
The additional element of the dynamic array (i.e. .dynamic section) is needed.	nonsec
If any specific relocation is encountered, the linker should resolve them and create the Global Offset Table.	nonsec
If any specific relocation is encountered, the linker should resolve them and create the Procedure Linkage Table.	nonsec

The functions are as follows:	nonsec
1) instruction matching When the client serve get a trading instruction, it will send the instruction to the CTS to trade with other trading instructions.	nonsec
The process of the trading includes the following two main principles: price first principle and the time first principle.	nonsec
If the trading fails when these two principles have been applied, we should refer to another principle.	nonsec

This layer will be plugged into the new model for population projections and water supply demand projections.	nonsec
Identify what lakes are stressed, when they became stressed, and if/when they came off stressed list.	nonsec
Track pumpage oddities.	nonsec
Two examples are:	nonsec
A. Permittees that have consistent pumpage readings even when some of the data is missing. 	nonsec
Use this information to predict whether they are in compliance in spite of the missing data.	nonsec
B. Permittees that enter zero on their pumpage reports.	nonsec
Track permittees not submitting conditional/pumpage reports, and generate a map showing their locations.	nonsec
Obtain report of those out of compliance of permit conditions by over-pumping their allowable quantities.	nonsec
Show how much over pumping is done, and have option to select by time period or by area.	nonsec
Need to break down to a permit-by-permit basis, but also show the whole thing on a map.	nonsec
Need a protocol to assess how the actual flow and levels (AFL) compare to the established minimum flows and levels (MFL), including general trending information and whether waterbody-specific criteria are being met.	nonsec
There are 3 major provisions to track:	nonsec
Minimum aquifer level - The saltwater intrusion MFL is met when the moving 10-year AFL is at or above the MFL for five consecutive years.	nonsec
The MFL is not met when the 10-year moving AFL in the reference wells is below the MFL for two consecutive years.	nonsec
Minimum flows on the upper Peace River - The MFL is met when the MFL's are at or above the established MFL for three consecutive years.	nonsec
Once the MFL has been considered met, if it is followed by two years where the MFL is not met within a rolling ten-year period, then the AFL shall be considered below the MFL.	nonsec
A determination of whether AFL's are meeting the established MFL is made at each one of the established minimums (Bartow, Ft. Meade and Zolfo Springs).	nonsec
Minimum lake levels - The proposed MFL is achieved when the long-term P50 is at or above the MFL and the long-term P10 is at or above the High Minimum Lake Level for five consecutive years.	nonsec
Once in compliance, MFL is not met when the long-term P50 is below the MFL for two or more consecutive years or the long-term P10 is below the High Minimum Lake Levels for two or more consecutive years.	nonsec
Use system to publish a chart or graph that compares the MFL to a running average of AFL's.	nonsec
This should reflect how the AFL's are moving along the MFL line and indicate how different resources impact the MFL.	nonsec
The resources to include are pumpage, new projects, and rainfall.	nonsec

The permittee has to stop pumping when certain levels are reached: • Augment lake when water levels are too high; • Pump water when chlorides concentrations too high; • Pump more out of well to pond & from pond to golf course; • Use more ground water when allowed to, when also q's for surface water.	nonsec
Need tool to be able to estimate water use (now being done in SAS).	nonsec
To do this estimate, you need to be able to query the water use data with various variables, such as time period, use types, withdrawal type (groundwater or surfacewater), and geographic areas.	nonsec
Once the initial query is complete, you need to be able to refine the resulting data set.	nonsec
An example is when you select active permits in a time period.	nonsec
If a permit expired inside of the time period, the refine tool would help determine if that permit would or would not be a part of the result set, perhaps by determining at what point in the time line it expired.	nonsec
Capture crop report data and link it with the corresponding use quantities, so you can observe changing crop patterns, see where land has shifted out of crops, and track water use per planted acre per crop to see patterns in water use by geography.	nonsec
The accumulation (or depletion) of credits by geographic area could point out potential problems in permitting in specific geographic areas.	nonsec
 It may point to soil type or local cultural practice problems.	nonsec

The use of agricultural models (SWAT, AnnAGNPS) is a core element of the CEAP effort.	nonsec
Several modeling-related database topics will need to be addressed:	nonsec
1. Maintenance and reporting of uncertainty or error in measured data, in spatial components of GIS data, and in modeling output.	nonsec
Reporting of uncertainty may take place on an individual sample basis, on a method or procedural basis, or on an entire database.	nonsec
2. Models will require specific input data and will generate output data during the calibration and validation phases, sensitivity analyses, and exploratory scenarios.	nonsec
The current scope of the STEWARDS system is to provide measured data for input to the model and for comparison to output.	nonsec
Design tools to navigate the individual watershed sites and their data.	nonsec
Summary descriptions of research watersheds, stations, and instruments that are useful in describing the research activities should be accessible.	nonsec

The potential for needing Gigabytes of data storage capacity is also in the realm of possibilities.	nonsec
Further requirements gathering is needed to get real-world estimates of such data storage needs.	nonsec
Near-line Storage – All User and Application data as well as software installation and configuration files must be fully backed up week-nightly.	nonsec
Further, secure, off-site storage will be performed on a weekly basis with 24-hour retrieval times.	nonsec
Load Balancing - Application Servers and Database servers must be load balanced at the application level to ensure maximum stability and availability.	nonsec
Specific scenarios, such as fail-over versus session-managed load balancing need to be addressed in the functional requirements specification.	nonsec
Private Network - The system requires a “back-end” private network environment in order to ensure that end-user operations (on the front-end) are not impeded by database backups, index propagations, or other large back-end data transfers.	nonsec
The system will use, where appropriate, the standard hardware and data communications resources provided by the ARS OCIO at the ARS George Washington Carver Center in Beltsville, MD. 	nonsec
This includes, but is not limited to, the general Ethernet network/T1 connection at the server/hosting site, network servers, and network management tools.	nonsec

Web Browsers and Browser Plug-ins – In support of External Interface requirements, commonly supported web browsers will be used to implement a thin-client architecture.	nonsec
The use of Browser plug-ins will be judiciously restricted on an as-needed basis.	nonsec
Email Services – As a secondary delivery protocol for alerts, data, and other information from the system, email server applications will be required to support system functionality.	nonsec
Relational Database Management System - As the primary data storage mechanism for the corporate standard relational database management system, Microsoft SQL Server will be required to support system functionality.	nonsec
The system will use, where appropriate, the standard software resources provided by the ARS OCIO.	nonsec
This includes, but is not limited to, MS ASP/Java Scripts, C++/C#, MS SQL server and IIS, or the use of PHP/Perl, JB scripts, C++/C#, MySQL server, and Apache server.	nonsec
The system will make data available in standardized data formats such as tab-delimited text for use on users’ client systems including local installations of ARC GIS software or other off-line software applications.	nonsec
Response time: The data system shall show no visible deterioration in response time as the number of persons increases.	nonsec
Response times seen by end users for querying metadata should be on the order of a few seconds or less.	nonsec
Response times seen by end users for retrieving the actual images may take much longer, anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.	nonsec
If the user requests a large image with a short response time, it is acceptable for the ARS data system to advise the user that the target response time cannot be met.	nonsec
Loading speed: The data system shall load as quickly as comparable productivity tools on whatever environment it is running in.	nonsec
Data on the server should be protected from power loss but data in transit from server to requester could be lost.	nonsec
Given that these data will also remain on the watershed site system, rather than expend resources to prevent this loss, such failures will be monitored and the uploading process will be repeated.	nonsec
STEWARDS will follow industry best practices for authentication, using single-sign-on systems like Microsoft Active Directory to perform authentication.	sec
Authentication addresses security requirements to ensure those using system are who they say they are.	sec
This is of greatest concern when data are being changed or updated.	sec
This is primarily done through userids and passwords.	sec
Confidentiality security requirements describe the need to protect the data appropriately.	sec
STEWARDS will use the user classes described in section 2.3 above to define boundaries of information sharing to ensure confidentiality as appropriate.	sec
Any data that should be viewed by a restricted audience must be protected with appropriate security features.	sec
The integrity of STEWARDS data will be critical to its success as a product.	sec
Scientific research and publications will be based on the data obtained through the system.	sec
Therefore, extensive data validation and review will be performed both before data are uploaded to the system and as part of the upload process.	sec
The system will need policy and procedures protecting the data from intentional or unintentional modifications, and to ensure accurate data are made available.	sec
The fourth consideration for security requirements is availability.	nonsec
The system must be available to the intended audience 24 hours per day, 7 days a week with, 99% availability and a tolerance of -5% (not less than 50% of working hours in any week).	nonsec
For this system, availability will be concerned with the reliability of the software and network components. Intentional “denial of service attacks” is not foreseen as a significant concern.	sec
Portability; This database will be built for a particular system and may not be portable but results to queries will be portable between many environments.	nonsec
Adaptability; Implementation of the application software/code and design of database structure should be flexible enough for the necessary change in the later phase.	nonsec
Availability;Availability is defined here to mean the ability to use the system during its intended period of operation as defined in SCR-4 above.	nonsec

For source generation GOG has 2 main options available: Universe Model from GaiaSimu or a Object Input Catalogue	nonsec
GOG has a source by source processing mechanism.	nonsec
GOG must consider noise effects.	nonsec
For noise generation those effects should be user-selectable (they can be added or not and the values should be given by users).	nonsec
We classify noises in two groups: 1. Instrumental noises: noises that come from observation process such as:on board detection and tracking or observation dead-time; 2. reduction noise: noise added to the data when removing instrumental noise.	nonsec
GOG I/O Catalogue format is driven by [AD3] .	nonsec
Main Data base format is defined in [AD1].	nonsec
GOG must give the same result for identical input configuration parameters.	nonsec

Determine for epoch data the astrometric parameter (with instrumental and reduction errors): transit times and field angles in each CCD mean transit time and field angle for the transit.	nonsec
Gate activation and signal loss due to window cutoff must be taken into account.	nonsec
Determine the epoch data photometry (with instrumental and reduction errors): G mag (for each CCD and average for the transit), GRP, GBP, GRVS .	nonsec

Determine the mean physical parameters (classification, Av, Teff , logg, FeH).	nonsec
Noise consideration on: • Flux noise (Poisson noise, total detection noise,...); • CCD combination noise for (RVS); • Wavelength calibration; • Multi-transit combination noise (only for combined data)should be added.	nonsec
The universe catalog output data of the simulation has to follow the universe model ICD document.	nonsec
Note: GaiaSimu library will allow to write and read this format.	nonsec
GOG output should be driven by the MDB data model.	nonsec
The output will be used to distribute extracts to the DPC’s.	nonsec
