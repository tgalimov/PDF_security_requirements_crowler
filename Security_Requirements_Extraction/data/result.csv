De-identifying patients for reporting is addressed in the ""Health record output"" functionality."	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to merge patient information from two patient records into a single patient record. If a duplicate chart is created, information could be merged into one chart.

This in the future would include the incorporation of medication history obtained from outside  electronic interfaces from insurers, PBMs, etc. ""User"" means medical and non-medical staff who are authorized by policy to enter prescriptions or other documentation."	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to enter uncoded or free text medications when medications are not on the vendor-provided medication database or information is insufficient to completely identify the medication. Medications that are not on the vendor-provided medication database or not enough information is available to completely identify the medication. This could be either uncoded (Synthroid unknown dose) or free text (blue hypertension pill).	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to record the date of changes made to a patient's medication list and the identity of the user who made the changes. This information may appear as an optional view rather than a required view on the main screen.  Need to capture the identity of the user and the date of changes made. Changes are to be recorded at the level of the individual medication.	nonsec
"The system shall provide the ability to modify or inactivate an item on the allergy and adverse reaction list. This could include removal, marking as erroneous, or marking as inactive.  ""Remove"" in this context implies specifying that an allergy or allergen specification is no longer valid or active, as opposed to deleting the information from the database entirely. Could include changing the type of reaction for a particular allergy."	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to capture and maintain, as discrete data, the identity of the user who added, modified, inactivated or removed items from the allergy and adverse reaction list, including attributes of the changed items.

The system shall provide the ability to capture, store, display, and manage patient history. Examples include past medical/surgical problems, diagnoses, procedures, family history and social history.	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to capture structured data in the patient history. This function demonstrates the ability of a system to capture structured data but does not define the required elements of the patient history that shall be structured.  Discrete data elements allow for searching and/or reporting by the EHR, and for this criterion the data could be free text or codified. Future functions would define the required patient history elements that shall be captured discretely as structured data, and where appropriate codified terminologies will be used.	nonsec
The system shall provide the ability to update a patient history by modifying, adding or removing items from the patient history as appropriate. Requirement not predicated on the capture of structured data.	nonsec
